# Swift Cheat Sheet

These are things that I lookup frequently or solutions I spent some time on. I hope they can help you too. This file will grow as I continue to build in Swift. My goal with this is to create a living document that ties together a lot of the disparate Swift solutions out there as people begin to pick up speed on the language.

(listed in order of appearance)
* Creating background gradients
* Playing a sound with AVFoundation
* Editing the text of a UIButton
* Setting the value of a textField a variety of ways
* Removing the keyboard from the view
* Focusing on a textField and bringing up the keyboard
* Hiding the status bar at the top of the view (the one with the battery and clock)
* Getting the last value of a model from CoreData
* Better storage of objects in CoreData
* Keep the phone from going to sleep
* Dismiss keyboard when pressing return in a UITextView
* Set a maximum amount of characters in a UITextView
* Add a person to AddressBook
* Use HexColors codes for UIColor
* Setting and retrieving NSUserDefaults

* More to come
